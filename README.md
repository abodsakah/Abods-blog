# Abod's blog
This is the main repo for my blog and the CMS that I built for my blog.

## Can I use this code?
Not really this code is made specifically for my blog but you are welcome to clone the repo and check things out, maybe I missed something and you can help me ;)


# Admin panel
![admin login](https://i.ibb.co/9HZj3f3/screely-1628461181336.png)
The Admin panel is used to be able to CRUD posts, change the editor's choice; and add CRUD pages. More functionalities are coming soon.
The admin panel is still WIP so don't expect too much from it.

What I am planning to do is to release the admin panel as a CMS for people wanting a CMS for their Node.js websites but there is still a lot of work that I have to do in it and a lot of functionalities that need to be added. The plan is to make something like WordPress or Joomla but for Node.js websites.
